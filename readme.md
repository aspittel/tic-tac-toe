# Tic Tac Toe

## Motivation
My motivation for this game was to have a simple game to use when I give talks to beginners! Tic tac toe shows a basic algorithm implementation to make it more efficient. Scores in rows, columns, and diagonals are stored rather than checking each row, column, and diagonal after each move. This makes the efficiency O(N) instead of O(N^2).

## Code Style
I stick to standard.js for JavaScript.

## Features
This game is pretty simple - it uses just vanilla JS. The algorithm is more efficient than a brute force implementation though!
